# Django-CarShop
University Django project "Car rental shop".


The aim of the project was to develop a web application that enables logged-in users to lend and rent cars. 
Moreover, admin has superuser privileges for managing the entire database.
#
Non-logged-in users can search for cars, but they cannot rent them.

#
The application allows users to create an account.

Users can also reset their passwords using a fake email mechanism.

#
The car owner can withdraw their car from lending when they no longer wish to make it available. Only admin is allowed to edit all cars.
